            <em><strong>Because I'm not very creative.</strong></em>
            

            <p>Seeing as I am in college, and have to do an assignment, I figured I might as well have some fun with it. I will be the first to admit that creativity has never been my strong suit, but at the same time, the two provided suggestions just didn't catch me. Not to <em> even suggest</em> they are bad choices mind you, they just weren't my style, and well, style is known to be subjective (Ignoring the few things that everyone can agree look terrible, but those are the exception, not the norm). What's that old saying again? Something like <q>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder</q>? Now granted, there may be some things that most people find attractive or unattractive, but that's besides the point that there is usually at least 1 person out there that finds something pleasant. Besides, arguing against that thought and saying is:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Being purposely obtuse,</li>
                <li>Being needlessly pedantic,</li>
                <li>Trying to disprove the letter of the saying, rather than the spirit, which itself is:<ul>
                   <li>Missing the point,</li>
                   <li>Not understanding that most sayings have implicit terms, such as being more in general than meaning to account for everything,</li>
                   <li>The sign of someone arguing just to argue, instead of prove a point.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now, I'm not meaning this as an insult, <em>just to clarify again,</em> Nor is that rant meant against or directed at the person grading this assignment, but rather some hypothetical individual seeking to poke holes in classing sayings and phrases for no good reason by being pointlessly obtuse, who let me reiterate again, <em>IS NOT REAL</em>. I just didn't personally feel like re-using the provided examples, as the buffalo river, while interesting, is not something I felt like making a web page about, and neither is the provided UALR data, so I instead just noticed I was going on a rant against a theoretical person localized entirely within my mind, and decided it would add a noteworthy amount of space to this article. (After all, even if the links <em>DO</em> work, what do they matter on a webpage too small to use them in any meaningful manner?)</p>
            <p>And besides, there are plenty of other things that I can fill space up with to make sure that the page can actually get long enough for the links to actually do something visually. For example:</p>
            </div>
            <!--First segment's div. Or 'chapter', I suppose. I COULD use a section for everything inside, but if I'm already using div, why bother? Especially when there is already a larger one outside.-->

            <h2 id="chart-segment-header">Here's a chart about random things and their traits:</h2>

            <div id="table-of-things">
            <table>

                    <td>Technically yes, but not really</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </div>
            <!--Table of thing's div.-->
            <p>I know that this makes little sense, but with what I have placed previously, it makes it very hard to find something to put in here that actually would make relevant sense, so I decided to just not pretend I had any ideas that would fit perfectly.</p>
            </div>
            <!--This is the div for the chart segment I made.-->
            <div id="image-segment">
            <h2 id="image-segment-header">Here's the College logo:</h2>
            <img src="https://thomaswallace.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ualr.png" alt="The logo for university of Arkansas, Little Rock.">
            <p>As far as logos go, it looks alright. Not too basic, but not overly complex, either. Anyways, here's a list about this page's capabilties so far:</p>
            <dl>
            <dt>Things this website can do:</dt>
            <dd>Exist</dd>
            <dd>Run on html-compliant browsers</dd>
            <dd>(Probably) not  collapse if someone breathes too hard</dd>
            <dd>Occupy storage space</dd>
            <dd></dd>
            <dt>I would say that description lists aren't meant to be used for this, but the source itself suggested using them for a FAQ.</dt>
            <dd>Besides, it isn't like other devices can't format this as needed, it isn't like I am just putting a header in the middle of a paragraph, or manually adding spaces.</dd>
            <dd>granted, like is shown above, it doesn't look as good if the description is longer than the term.</dd>
            <dd>then again, what is this, but me decided what terms get their own line based on how they look?</dd>
            <dd>If overused or misused, I could see this causing problems on other devices, but it isn't like I'm writing everything on the page in this list, and it isn't like the additional text provided says <em>I HAVE</em> to use it solely for terms and definitions.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>And besides, it's a list, not me manually placing spaces to make it look better - it should be handled by other devices fine, unlike the example given in class a while back of just placing a ton of spaces to make it look better on desktop.</p>
            <p>Now, for the only way I can think of (besides writing at least 2-3 pages) to get more headers, while still technically complying with the rules given involving them: Using them to divide a series of less and less important information.</p>
            </div>
            <!--image segment's div - this was the best place I could think of to place this one.-->
            <div id="header-abuse">
            <h2 id="header-abuse-header">Now, watch as I perform needless cruelty against headers.</h2>
            <p>(Yes, I know that a paragraph, chart, or list is a better choice for this, but since headers of higher numbers are for less and less important information, I felt this would be fine enough. That, and I lack the inspiration to go on for 2-3 pages and naturally work all the different headers in, especially since you could make the arguement that they are not all always needed in a given page. After all, headers are mainly for titles, and highlighting noteworthy divisions in paragraphs between areas of equal importance (or at least, between all instances of headers of the same rank, i.e multiple h2 headers have content of similar importance, but the h6 is always less important, and the h1 will always be more important.), so if what you are writing is disconnected, or short enough, I could reasonably expect some of the higher number headers to not appear, (barring h6, which is used for the footer.)</p>
            <h3>My thoughs on various food:</h3>
            <h4>Pizza:</h4>
            <h5>It tastes good, but can be boring sometimes. It can also have too much grease.</h5>
            <p>Granted, that is moreso dependent on the place you buy it from, but still.</p>
            <h4>Burgers:</h4>
            <h5>Also good, but again, depending on the place, it can be too greasy.</h5>
            <p>Depending on the place, again, a lot about the burger can change.</p>
            <h4>Chicken:</h4>
            <h5><strong>good</strong></h5>
            <p>yes</p>
            <h3>My thoughst on cars:</h3>
            <h4>Van:</h4>
            <h5>They exist.</h5>
            <p>I don't think about cars much in general.</p>
            <h4>Racecar:</h4>
            <h5>Also exists.</h5>
            <p>Again, I just don't think about them much.</p>
            <p>I know this isn't the greatest use of headers, but since they are mainly used to sepearte information to levels of decreasing importance, combined with the fact that aside from just pulling in fake text (which I am both too lazy, and to bored at the idea of to do, I figured this was roughly fine.)</p>
            </div>
            <!--header abuse's div end.-->
            <div id="ending-quote">
            <h2>Here's a random quote (that a website says is) by ghandi, to end the main page with.</h2>

            <!--I had thought the cite would make the blockquote show where the comment is from, but it doesn't seem too. Mind you, it doesn't seem to break anything either, so I'll leave it in.-->
            </div>
            <!--Technically small enough to not have a div, but I figured it was best to not leave it out.-->
            </section>
            <!--I was debating also adding in sections for each little psuedo-chapter, but since dive was already required, and there was already a larger section in place, it would be redundant to add. I might have said something like this already, but I don't care enough to check.-->

Also, I just assumed that the current year was meant, and used that. I was worried that #top wouldn't work, as for a second I thought it maybe required an ID i forgot to place, but it worked flawlessly, which is good. After looking it up, it seems that #top doesn't need to be specifically implemented, as newer browsers have it implied, which is probably why it worked instantly.-->
