            <em><strong>Because I'm not very creative.</strong></em>
            

            <p>Seeing as I am in college, and have to do an assignment, I figured I might as well have some fun with it. I will be the first to admit that creativity has never been my strong suit, but at the same time, the two provided suggestions just didn't catch me. Not to <em> even suggest</em> they are bad choices mind you, they just weren't my style, and well, style is known to be subjective (Ignoring the few things that everyone can agree look terrible, but those are the exception, not the norm). What's that old saying again? Something like <q>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder</q>? Now granted, there may be some things that most people find attractive or unattractive, but that's besides the point that there is usually at least 1 person out there that finds something pleasant. Besides, arguing against that thought and saying is:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Being purposely obtuse,</li>
                <li>Being needlessly pedantic,</li>
                <li>Trying to disprove the letter of the saying, rather than the spirit, which itself is:<ul>
                   <li>Missing the point,</li>
                   <li>Not understanding that most sayings have implicit terms, such as being more in general than meaning to account for everything,</li>
                   <li>The sign of someone arguing just to argue, instead of prove a point.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now, I'm not meaning this as an insult, <em>just to clarify again,</em> Nor is that rant meant against or directed at the person grading this assignment, but rather some hypothetical individual seeking to poke holes in classing sayings and phrases for no good reason by being pointlessly obtuse, who let me reiterate again, <em>IS NOT REAL</em>. I just didn't personally feel like re-using the provided examples, as the buffalo river, while interesting, is not something I felt like making a web page about, and neither is the provided UALR data, so I instead just noticed I was going on a rant against a theoretical person localized entirely within my mind, and decided it would add a noteworthy amount of space to this article. (After all, even if the links <em>DO</em> work, what do they matter on a webpage too small to use them in any meaningful manner?)</p>
            <p>And besides, there are plenty of other things that I can fill space up with to make sure that the page can actually get long enough for the links to actually do something visually. For example:</p>
            <h2 id="chart-segment">Here's a chart about random things and their traits:</h2>

            <caption>Things and traits:</caption>
            <table border="1">

                    <td>Yes</td>
                    <td>No - needs driver or gravity</td>
                    <td>Technically yes, if broken apart first</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rock</td>
                    <td>No</td>
                    <td>Possibly - varies</td>
                    <td>No - cannot move on its own</td>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hamburger</td>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                    <td>No</td>
                    <td>No - must be poisoned first</td>
                    <td>Technically yes, but not really</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>I know that this makes little sense, but with what I have placed previously, it makes it very hard to find something to put in here that actually would make relevant sense, so I decided to just not pretend I had any ideas that would fit perfectly.</p>

            <img src="https://thomaswallace.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ualr.png" alt="The logo for university of Arkansas, Little Rock." />
            <p>As far as logos go, it looks alright. Anyways, I'm probably going to put more here later.</p>

                <!--Admittedly, I also double-checked this one. I remembered the gist, but the specifics have yet to be ground into my memory. Also, I just assumed that the current year was meant, and used that. I was worried that #top wouldn't work, as for a second I thought it maybe required an ID i forgot to place, but it worked flawlessly, which is good. After looking it up, it seems that #top doesn't need to be specifically implemented, as newer browsers have it implied, which is probably why it worked instantly.-->
